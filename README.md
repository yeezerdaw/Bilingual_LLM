bilingual-tamil-llm

Small project for building bilingual Tamil-English datasets and experiments.

Contents
- notebooks for preprocessing and data generation
- cleaned JSONL datasets in `data_cleaned/`
- raw datasets in `data/` (excluded from git via .gitignore)

Getting started
1. Initialize git (we'll do this for you) and create a GitHub repository.
2. Add a remote and push:

   git remote add origin git@github.com:<your-username>/<repo>.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main

Notes
- Large data files and model binaries are intentionally ignored. Keep them out of the repo and use release assets or external storage.
